In one respect, however, the business models of payday and auto title lenders and consumer finance companies are similar. Both generally offer only a small number of products, and their revenue streams are not diversified: They rely heavily on existing borrowers to frequently refinance loans or reborrow to generate revenue.34 This means that operating expenses are spread over a relatively small number of borrowers per store, which contributes to the loansâ€™ high costs.35 (See Figure 4.) Consumer finance companies are somewhat more efficient than payday lenders in this regard, serving more than 700 unique borrowers at an average location annually, compared with about 500 and 300 at payday and auto title stores, respectively.
