One of the borrowers in the focus groups, who was aware of the difference between stated and all-in APRs, explained, “There’s a big difference between the [stated] percentage rate and what you’re really being charged.” As an example, a stated APR for a nine-month, $511 loan issued in Kentucky was 43 percent, but the all-in APR was 138 percent. (See Figure 6.) Because the lender sold credit insurance with the loan and financed the $203 lump-sum premium, the amount financed increased from $511 to $714, which resulted in higher interest and other charges.41 When all the fees and insurance premiums were included, the all-in APR was 138 percent, three times more than the stated APR.
