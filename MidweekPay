When loan contracts include credit insurance or other ancillary products, the lump-sum premiums or other charges are financed by default, which increases both the total amount borrowed and the amount of interest the borrower pays.39 The cost of these products does not count toward the stated APR, resulting in loan agreements where the rate stated in the contract is often significantly lower than the all-in APR.40 (See Figure 5.) This practice enables installment lenders to contractually comply with state interest rate caps while issuing loans with all-in APRs that often exceed those regulations. It also conceals the all-in APRs from borrowers, which makes it extremely difficult for consumers to evaluate credit products and compare costs.
